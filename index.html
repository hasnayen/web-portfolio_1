                <h1>My Hobby</h1>

                <p>For a student, a hobby would mean taking some time off from classes and utilizing it for something
                    that he likes to do. A hobby should come to you naturally. It should not be enforced by anyone. If
                    it has to be enforced upon you then, you will soon lose interest in it. The main purpose of a hobby
                    would be lost. Some people like to read books as a hobby. It is a great way to improve one’s
                    vocabulary. This makes them aware of plenty of things that schools might not teach them. Life is
                    short, and the world is vast. There is a galaxy of knowledge out there, waiting for us to stumble
                    upon it. That is the main purpose of hobbies. To make us aware of things those are beyond the
                    confines of our classroom walls.</p>

                <h1>Communication Skills</h1>

                <p>Having strong communication skills aids in all aspects of life – from professional life to personal
                    life and everything that falls in between. From a business standpoint, all transactions result from
                    communication. Good communication skills are essential to allow others and yourself to understand
                    information more accurately and quickly.In contrast, poor communication skills lead to frequent
                    misunderstanding and frustration. In a 2016 LinkedIn survey conducted in the United States,
                    communication topped the list of the most sought-after soft skills among employers.</p>
